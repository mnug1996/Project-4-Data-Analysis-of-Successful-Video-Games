# Project 4 Data Analysis of Patterns in Succesful Video Games

## Introduction to the project:

The goal for this project is to identify patterns in successful video games for the online store Ice. The data goes back from 2016, so the focus is to plan a campaign for 2017.

## Outline summary:

* Open the data file and study the general information
* Prepare the data:
  * Filled in missing values, confirmed and dealt with any duplicate rows, and converted columns to appropriate data types for analysis.
  * Calculated the total sales (the sum of sales in all regions) for each game and put these values in a separate column.
* Analyze the data:
  * Used pivot tables, histograms, line graphs, scatter matrices, and bar graphs to solve important questions and tasks:
    * Look at how many games were released in different years. Is the data for every period significant?
    * Look at how sales varied from platform to platform. Choose platforms with the greatest total sales and build a distribution based on data for each year. 
    * Find platforms that used to be popular but now have zero sales. 
    * How long does it generally take for new platforms to appear and old ones to fade?
    * Determine what period you should take data for. To do so, look at your answers to the previous questions. The data should allow you to build a prognosis for 2017.
    * Work only with the data that you've decided is relevant. Disregard the data for previous years.
    * Which platforms are leading in sales? Which ones are growing or shrinking? Select several potentially profitable platforms.
    * Build a box plot for the global sales of all games, broken down by platform. Are the differences in sales significant? What about average sales on various platforms? Describe your findings.
    * Take a look at how user and professional reviews affect sales for one popular platform (you choose). Build a scatter plot and calculate the correlation between reviews and sales. Draw conclusions.
    * Keeping your conclusions in mind, compare the sales of the same games on other platforms.
    * Take a look at the general distribution of games by genre. What can we say about the most profitable genres? Can you generalize about genres with high and low sales?
* Create a user profile for each region:
  * For each region (NA, EU, JP), determine:
  * The top five platforms. Describe variations in their market shares from region to region.
  * The top five genres. Explain the difference.
  * Do ESRB ratings affect sales in individual regions?
* Test the following hypotheses:
  * Average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.
  * Average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.
    * Set the alpha threshold value yourself.
  * Explain:
    * How you formulated the null and alternative hypotheses.
    * What significance level you chose to test the hypotheses, and why.
* Write a general conclusion
